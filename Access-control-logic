# üîê Access Control Logic Using Excel

## üìò Overview

This Excel-based project simulates a simple **Access Control System** using conditional logic. It determines whether a user is granted or denied access based on their **role**, **password**, and **entry pass status**.

It's a practical demonstration of Excel functions like `IF`, `AND`, and `OR`, commonly used in business rule automation and real-world decision logic.

## üß† Access Rules

Access is granted based on the following logic:

| Role           | Access Criteria                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**      | Access only if `Password = 1234`                      |
| **VIP**        | Access if `Password = 1234` **OR** `EntryPass = Valid`|
| **Senior Admin** | Always gets access regardless of conditions         |
| **Guest/Others** | Access Denied                                       |
